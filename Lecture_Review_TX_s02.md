### I. Fitness and selection

1. Fitness: an abstract concept measuring how much an individual contributes to the next generation
    * Absolute fitness (Malthusian fitness): the (expected) number of offsprings a particular individual leaves in the next generation.
    * Relative fitness: absolute fitness scaled by the population-wide mean fitness.
    * Fitness can be defined on various levels (genotypes, alleles, individuals etc.), but it’s most often defined on the level where selection operates (an individual’s genotype).
    
2. Types of mutations: beneficial, deleterious, neutral

3. Types of selection in terms of:
    * Its effect on a particular allele:
      * Positive selection: increases the allele frequency
      * Negative selection: decreases the allele freqeuency (also called purifying selection)
    * Its effect on a trait (usually polygenic):
      * Stabilizing selection: maintains the current mean trait value
      * Directional selection: increases or decreases the mean trait value
      * Disruptive selection: in favor of deviating from the current mean
